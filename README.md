# `kleene-project`
#### Josh Oettinger, Nathaniel Lovin, Tenzin Dolphen

This is a `Scheme` interpreter written in `C` as a final project for CS251.

## TODO
-   [x] Previously, if a `CONS_TYPE` wasn't any of the special forms, our eval method just printed out its value. We should fix this, because it prevents the program from catching a lot of bad syntax.
-   [ ] For some reason, `(+)` does not seem to call the plus function correctly, but `(+ )` does.
-   [ ] Add quote shorthand (`'`)
-   More stuff
